- **Summarization:** Uses a pre-trained NLP model to condense website content into meaningful insights.
- **Customizable Output:** Generates a professional summary using a Jinja2 template.
- **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling for scraping, summarization, and file operations.

## Files in the Repository
1. **`prospect_workflow.py`:** The main script to execute the workflow.
2. **`template.txt`:** A Jinja2 template for formatting the output summary.
